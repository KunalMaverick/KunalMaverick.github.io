## Hello there! My name is Kunal Kishore

- I’m a final-year undergraduate (4th year) student in **Electronics and Communication Engineering** at **PES University, Bangalore**.
- I spend most of my time thinking about how real workloads behave on hardware, especially from the perspective of **computer architecture**, **memory systems**, and **HPC**.
- I like working across different levels of the stack — sometimes that means microarchitecture or ISA details, other times it’s accelerator design or understanding where time and data actually go.
- I run occasionally, mostly to clear my head 🏃‍♂️.

### Research Interests:-

- Computer Architecture 
- High Performance Computing 
- Embedded Systems
- Hardware Software Co-Design


### Current Research

- **Research Intern @ CSE Dept., IIT Hyderabad**  
  - Investigating **KV-cache behavior in LLM inference** and how **data movement bottlenecks** shape performance on constrained and accelerator-centric systems.

- **Remote Collaborator @ Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) — AccelCom Group**  
  - Working on **RISC-V vector (RVV)–based kernels** and exploring **workload behavior and performance trade-offs** from a systems and architecture perspective.


### Undergraduate Thesis

- **SABRE: A Compression-Aware BF16 Accelerator for Neuromorphic Attention**
  - Design of a **BF16 accelerator in Bluespec SystemVerilog** for **spiking / recurrent attention mechanisms** used in neuromorphic language models.  
  - Focused on **compute and execution behavior**, **numerical stability**, and **data movement efficiency**, with **activation-aware compression** explored alongside the architecture to reduce **latency and memory footprint**.

### Open-Source & Systems Work

- **openCompute (ongoing)**
  - Developing a reusable and parameterizable **Bluespec-based accelerator IP library** for compute, control, and memory subsystems, aimed at rapid architecture exploration across different precision, parallelism, and memory organization choices.

### Previous Research Experience

- **Research Intern @ RISE Lab, IIT Madras**
  - Implemented **IEEE-754–compliant FP32 math units** in Bluespec SystemVerilog, including a **CORDIC-based tanh(x)** engine and a **Newton–Raphson reciprocal** module.

- **Research Intern** @ [CORI](https://cori.pes.edu/), PES
    - Co-authored and published a research paper titled "Design and Evaluation of a Real-Time Gesture
      Controlled Television" at the IEEE Zooming Innovation in Consumer Technologies Conference (ZINC) 
      2024 with [Dr. Manikandan J](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Xw--zsIAAAAJ).
